# Hypertension-Risk-Prediction-dashboard (Excel)

This project presents an interactive dashboard designed to analyze and predict the risk of hypertension using patient health data. The goal is to support individulas, healthcare practitioners, researchers, and policymakers in identifying at-risk individuals and exploring key health indicators associated with hypertension.

##  Overview
Hypertension is a major global health risk. Healthcare organizations often face large, complex datasets but struggle to pinpoint the key drivers behind high blood pressure risks. Without clear insights, prevention strategies remain ineffective. My dashboard brings those insights into focus.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:
ðŸ”¹52% of patients had hypertension

ðŸ”¹ Majority were in the 26-45 age group

ðŸ”¹ Most hypertensive patients were not on any medication.

ðŸ”¹ Major contributors to hypertension included: high stress, age, salt intake, obesity,family history, low exercise, short sleep

## ðŸ“ˆ Skill Demonstrated:
 - Microsoft Excel
 -  IF and AND formula to categorize age, salt intake, stress, and BMI, creating a foundation for meaningful analysis.
 - Power Pivot (Data Model)
  - Pivot Tables & Charts
  - Slicers  
  - Conditional Formatting
  - DAX (basic usage in calculated fields)

## ðŸ”— Recommendations:
1.  Promote preventive screenings for individuals over 40 years.
2.  Launch awareness programs targeting lifestlye modification.
3.  Encourage regular monitoring of glucose and cholesterol to manage early risks.
4.  Integrate the dashboard into hospital management systems for real-time monitoring.
5.  Explore personalized health interventions based on predictive modeling results.
